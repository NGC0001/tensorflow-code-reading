### C++ Syntax
- [C++ Function Object](https://leimao.github.io/blog/CPP-Function-Object/): Function object is any object for which the function call operator is defined, i.e., `operator()` is overloaded. It is also called functor.


- [inline Specifier Compilation](https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inline-Specifier-Compilation): The `inline` specifier will suggest compiler (not guarantee) to place a copy of the code of that function at each point where the function is called at compile time.
